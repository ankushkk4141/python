Let's start with some theory and basics first...

What is Python ?
Python is a simple and easy to understand programming language.
Python is a general purpose high level programming language.
Python is recommended as first programming language for beginners.

Usage of Python ?
For developing Desltop Applications
For developing Web Applications
For developing developing Games
For developing Machine Learning
For developing IOT & list goes on & on

Features of Python ?
Simple & easy to learn
  Python is a simple programming language. When we read Python program,we can feellike reading english statements.
Freeware and OpenSource
  We can use Python software without any licence and it is freeware.
Platform Independent
  Once we write a Python program,it can run on any platform without rewriting once again.
  Internally PVM is responsible to convert into machine understandable form
Portability
  Python programs are portable. ie we can migrate from one platform to anotherplatform very easily. 
  Python programs will provide same results on any paltform.
Dynamically Typed
  In Python we are not required to declare type for variables. Whenever we are assigning the value, based on value, type will be allocated automatically.Hence Python is considered as dynamically typed language.

Limitations of Python:
  Performance wise not up to the mark because it is interpreted language.
  Not using for mobile Applications.

Modules
  A module is a file containing code written by someone else (usually) which can be imported and used in our programs (similar to library)

Pip
  Pip is the package manager for python you can use pip to install a module on your system

Types of modules
 There are two types of modules
    Built in modules - preinstall in python
    External modules - Need to install using pip

How to writes comment in python?
  There are two types of comments in python 
    Single line comment - written using '#'
    Multiline comments - written using '''Comments'''   (See Code file for more clarity)
 
Identifiers
A Name in Python Program is called Identifier.
It can be Class Name OR Function Name OR Module Name OR Variable Name.

The only allowed characters in Python are
  alphabetical symbols (either lowercase or upper case)
  digits (0 to 9)
  underscore symbol (_)
Rules:
  alphabetical symbols (either lowercase or upper case)
  if starts with underscore it;s private
  it should not start with digit
  we can't use reserved words as identifier, for e.g def=10 is not allowed
  $ symbolis not allowed in python.

Reserved Words
  In Python some words are reserved to represent some meaning or functionality.
  Such types of words are called reserved words.
    There are 33 reserved words available in Python.
      true, false, none
      and, or, nor, is
      if, else, elif
      while, for, break, continue, return, yield, in
      try, except, finally, raise assert
      import, from, as, class, def, pass, global, nonlocal, lambda, del, with
   All Reserved words in Python contain only alphabet symbols
   Except the following True, False & None reserved words, all contain only lower case alphabet symbols
